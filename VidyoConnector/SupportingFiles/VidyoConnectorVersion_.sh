# NOTE: A freely-available version-numbering helper for Xcode was REJECTED:
# - See Apple's "Technical Q&A QA1827: Automating Version and Build Numbers
#   Using agvtool" at <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1827/>.
# - 'agvtool' is limited (or strongly tied) to macOS. / Our scheme allows for
#   version-numbering updates under any OS where this file can be modified.
# - 'agvtool' can integrate with a few version-control systems (but the feature
#   seems like an unnecessary entanglement). / Our scheme is not tied to any
#   version-control system, so it should be compatible with any of them.
